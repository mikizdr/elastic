==================================
I just want to ask you about Elastic Completion Sugester - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters-completion.html
Did you use it in setting up Elasticserach environment? I mean, do we have it in our project?
 
*** Prashant
No
This is other way of autocomplete
And this works very good when we need it for multi word sentence
But for our use as as city could be maximum one word or 2 or so
So what this autocomplete does,
Say you have title field " hello my name is Prashant" then it will make analyzed to store the word as hello , my, name , Prashant
So of someone searches prashant , it will suggest hello my name is Prashant
For single or few words I mostly use ngram
But over and above both does same thing
